The authors focused on examining three practical but important questions: are there a common set of student activity variables that predict student performance in different courses? Which machine-learning classifiers tend to perform consistently well across different courses? Can the authors develop a general model for use in multiple courses to predict student performance based on LMS data? Design/methodology/approach Three mandatory undergraduate courses with large class sizes were selected from three different faculties at a large Western Canadian University, namely, faculties of science, engineering and education. Course-specific models for these three courses were built and compared using data from two semesters, one for model building and the other for generalizability testing. Findings The investigation has led the authors to conclude that it is not desirable to develop a general model in predicting course failure across variable courses. However, for the science course, the predictive model, which was built on data from one semester, was able to identify about 70% of students who failed the course and 70% of students who passed the course in another semester with only LMS data extracted from the first four weeks. Originality/value The results of this study are promising as they show the usability of LMS for early prediction of student course failure, which has the potential to provide students with timely feedback and support in higher education institutions.","tags":["Higher education","Learning analytics","Learning management system","Predictive models","Student activity data","Student course success"],"title":"Scale up predictive models for early detection of at-risk students: A feasibility study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fu Chen","Alfred Sakyi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1571184000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571184000,"objectID":"e2c56b8a1202062c0dc9a4d196a8cc74","permalink":"https://brave-carson-2b4c80.netlify.app/conferences/abed-2019-chen/","publishdate":"2020-05-29T21:04:46-06:00","relpermalink":"/conferences/abed-2019-chen/","section":"Conferences","summary":"Poster presented at the 2019 Alberta Research Network Meeting, Edmonton, AB","tags":[],"title":"Influential factors contributing to students’ mathematics achievement (PISA 2012): A comparison between Alberta and Quebec","type":"Conferences"},{"authors":["Ying Cui","Man-Wai Chu","Fu Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559347200,"objectID":"798f4e5b818693fd240468fbe444b35b","permalink":"https://brave-carson-2b4c80.netlify.app/publication/cui-analyzing-2019/","publishdate":"2020-05-30T00:32:28.243291Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cui-analyzing-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Bayesian Knowledge Tracing","Dynamic Bayesian Networks","Evidence-Centered Design","formative feedback","game-based assessment","process data analysis"],"title":"Analyzing student process data in game-based assessments with Bayesian knowledge tracing and dynamic Bayesian network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fu Chen","Hongmei Yang","Okan Bulut","Ying Cui","Tao Xin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559347200,"objectID":"5eeeb96afc239cfc8ef379d2681386d4","permalink":"https://brave-carson-2b4c80.netlify.app/publication/chen-examining-2019/","publishdate":"2020-05-30T00:32:28.242104Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-examining-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper explores how personality factors affect substance use disorders (SUDs) using explanatory item response modeling (EIRM). A total of 606 Chinese illicit drug users participated in our study. After removing the cases with missing values on the covariate measures, a final sample of 573 participants was used for data analysis. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) was used to measure the illicit drug users’ SUD level. Four personality factors–anxiety sensitivity, impulsivity, sensation seeking and hopelessness–along with gender and alcohol use were included in EIRM as person covariates. The results indicated that gender, alcohol use, and their interaction significantly predicted the SUD level. The only personality factor that strongly predicted the SUD level was sensation seeking. In addition, the interaction between gender and hopelessness was also found to be a significant predictor of the SUD level, indicating that the negative effect of hopelessness on SUD is stronger for women than for men. The findings suggest that sensation seeking plays an important role in influencing SUDs, and thus, it should be considered when designing intervention or screening procedures for potential illicit drug users. In addition, several DSM-5 SUD symptoms were found to exhibit differential effects by gender, alcohol use, and personality factors. The possible explanations were discussed.","tags":["Alcohol consumption","Alcoholism","Alcohols","Drug users","Impulsivity","Personality","Recreational drug use","Sensory perception"],"title":"Examining the relation of personality factors to substance use disorder by explanatory item response modeling of DSM-5 symptoms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ying Cui","Shiri Ali","Fu Chen"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556668800,"objectID":"53ad844495b5f39bf389ae77613fe93d","permalink":"https://brave-carson-2b4c80.netlify.app/conferences/ftl-2019-cui/","publishdate":"2020-05-29T21:08:55-06:00","relpermalink":"/conferences/ftl-2019-cui/","section":"Conferences","summary":"Paper presented at the 2019 Festival of Teaching and Learning at University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB","tags":[],"title":"Enhancing student success through predictive learning analytics","type":"Conferences"},{"authors":["Hongmei Yang","Fu Chen","Xiaoxiao Liu","Tao Xin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"b5e132072a28912e4f184f328c79eaa5","permalink":"https://brave-carson-2b4c80.netlify.app/publication/yang-item-2019/","publishdate":"2020-05-30T00:32:28.24377Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yang-item-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"The study examined the dimensionality and psychometric properties of DSM-5 criteria for heroin use disorder in a clinical sample of Chinese adolescents using item response theory approach.

These models provide evidence for validating learning progressions and also make diagnosis about students. In addition, learning progressions have provided new perspectives for vertical scaling and adaptive learning. But we should be aware of some questions, such as differential item functioning.","tags":null,"title":"Applying psychometric models in learning progressions studies: Theory, method and breakthrough","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fu Chen","Yanlou Liu","Tao Xin"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1493337600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493337600,"objectID":"c83594f3d898a0ce4006c3e4d8e7d6d9","permalink":"https://brave-carson-2b4c80.netlify.app/conferences/ncme-2017-chen/","publishdate":"2020-05-29T21:11:25-06:00","relpermalink":"/conferences/ncme-2017-chen/","section":"Conferences","summary":"Paper presented at the 2017 Annual Meeting of the National Council on Measurement in Education, San Antonio, TX","tags":[],"title":"Applying M2 statistic to evaluate the fit of hierarchical diagnostic classification models","type":"Conferences"},{"authors":["Fu Chen","Yue Yan","Tao Xin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1485907200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1485907200,"objectID":"9265870976f201ab1bf07bff2c2c21af","permalink":"https://brave-carson-2b4c80.netlify.app/publication/chen-developing-2017/","publishdate":"2020-05-30T00:32:28.244956Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-developing-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"The current study focuses on developing the learning progression of number sense for primary school students, and it applies a cognitive diagnostic model, the rule space model, to data analysis. The rule space model analysis firstly extracted nine cognitive attributes and their hierarchy model from the analysis of previous research and the mathematics textbook used in Beijing. A cognitive diagnostic test for number sense was then developed based upon the cognitive attributes. Finally, the model was used to analyse a sample of 1207 Chinese primary school students’ observed item responses to identify their knowledge states and to validate and modify the hypothesised learning progression. The results showed that the test was of good psychometric quality, and that the hypothesised learning progression was generally validated. By applying the rule space model, the hypothesised learning progression was modified at each level. The results also showed that students in grade 3, grade 4 and grade 5 were mainly classified into level 1 and level 2, level 2–level 4 and level 5 of the modified learning progression, respectively. These results suggest the feasibility and benefits of using cognitive diagnostic models to develop learning progressions.","tags":["cognitive diagnostic model","learning path","learning progression","Number sense","rule space model"],"title":"Developing a learning progression for number sense based on the rule space model in China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shanshan Zhang","Jiaxuan Du","Ping Chen","Tao Xin","Fu Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"4218e74ca30fe4e7dd430e901a572f96","permalink":"https://brave-carson-2b4c80.netlify.app/publication/zhang-using-2017/","publishdate":"2020-05-30T00:32:28.246141Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhang-using-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"In spite of the growing interest in the methods of evaluating the classification consistency (CC) indices, there is little research on the field of applying these methods in the practice of large-scale educational assessment. In addition, few studies considered the influence of practical factors, for example, the examinee ability distribution, the cut score location and the score scale, on the performance of CC indices. Using the newly developed Lee’s procedure based on the item response theory (IRT), the main purpose of the article is to investigate the performance of CC indices when practical factors are taken into consideration. A simulation study and an empirical study were conducted under comprehensive conditions. Results suggested that with negatively skewed distribution, the CC indices were larger than with other distributions. Interactions occurred between ability distribution, cut score location and score scale. Consequently, Lee’s IRT procedure is reliable to be used in the field of large-scale educational assessment and when reporting the indices it should be treated with caution since testing conditions may vary a lot.","tags":["ability distribution","classification consistency index","cut score","item response theory","score transformation rule"],"title":"Using procedure based on item response theory to evaluate classification consistency indices in the practice of large-scale assessment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fu Chen","Tao Xin","Yanlou Liu","Tuo Liu","Wei Tian"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1480550400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1480550400,"objectID":"5852edb2ae6c44452516eb1ec0ea3ec1","permalink":"https://brave-carson-2b4c80.netlify.app/publication/chen-model-data-2016/","publishdate":"2020-05-30T00:32:28.247319Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-model-data-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"Cognitive diagnosis models (CDMs) are one family of psychometric models developed primarily for assessing examinees’ mastery and non-mastery of skills or attributes.

Comprehensive and structural introduction and evaluation of the model-data fit test methods and related statistics are intended to aid the future cognitive diagnostic studies and practice.

Several theories, such as Social Interaction Theory, Dramaturgy Theory, Behavioral Consistency Paradigm, and Trait Activation Theory, have been trying to explain the behaviors and response of interviewers and applicants in structural interviews. An integral structural interview can be divided into three phases: rapport-building, questioning / responding, and rating of applicants by interviewers. During the interview, interviewers would experience a series of mental activities, including observing, acquiring, analyzing and responding to applicants′ performance, forming the initial impression, then completing rating by referring to rating standard. The major factors that may influence an interviewer′s judgment involve two types of factors, the first type is internal ones, including designing factors and interviewer factors; the second type is external ones, including applicants′ factors and environmental factors. The future breakthrough in this field of research should include the exploration of psychological mechanism of interviewer′s rating combined with the applicants′ reactions in the interviews.","tags":null,"title":"Interviewer’s rating and influencing factors in structural interviews","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wenya Li","Wei Zhang","Fu Chen","Jianping Xu"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1384473600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1384473600,"objectID":"8fc83e37505825a6e126aa40ea562a2b","permalink":"https://brave-carson-2b4c80.netlify.app/conferences/china-2013-li/","publishdate":"2020-05-29T21:17:10-06:00","relpermalink":"/conferences/china-2013-li/","section":"Conferences","summary":"Paper presented at the 16th National Academic Congress of Psychology, Nanjing, China","tags":[],"title":"The effects of interviewees’ nonverbal clues on interviewers’ ratings","type":"Conferences"},{"authors":["Yizhu Gao","Ying Cui","Fu Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"4b8ac4e2fd017abceb1bd05ae307ef2a","permalink":"https://brave-carson-2b4c80.netlify.app/paper-review/gao-ict/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/paper-review/gao-ict/","section":"paper-review","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Examining the relation of information and communication technology usage to collaborative problem solving by hierarchical linear modeling","type":"paper-review"},{"authors":["Fu Chen","Alfred Sakyi","Ying Cui"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"4d5245280a00f7896076f17499f64383","permalink":"https://brave-carson-2b4c80.netlify.app/paper-review/chen-reading-machine-learning/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/paper-review/chen-reading-machine-learning/","section":"paper-review","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Identifying key contextual factors of top performers in digital reading through a machine learning approach","type":"paper-review"},{"authors":["Yizhu Gao","Ying Cui","Xiaoming Zhai","Fu Chen","Tao Xin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"53aefbe3494ae12cdd35251801e47da0","permalink":"https://brave-carson-2b4c80.netlify.app/paper-review/gao-buoyancy/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/paper-review/gao-buoyancy/","section":"paper-review","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Re-validating a learning progression of buoyancy for middle school students","type":"paper-review"},{"authors":["Jinnie Shin","Fu Chen","Chang Lu","Okan Bulut"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8f26db711bff59b3c414afaee8b4912b","permalink":"https://brave-carson-2b4c80.netlify.app/paper-review/shin-time-series/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/paper-review/shin-time-series/","section":"paper-review","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Using time-series prediction to inform test administration decisions in formative assessment","type":"paper-review"},{"authors":["Fu Chen","Alfred Sakyi","Ying Cui"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"7eb69e36bf1695e2999727c8c09463ae","permalink":"https://brave-carson-2b4c80.netlify.app/paper-review/chen-multilevel-sem/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/paper-review/chen-multilevel-sem/","section":"paper-review","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"What makes a good reader?
