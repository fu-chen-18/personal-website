I am currently a PhD student in Measurement, Evaluation, and Data science at the University of Alberta. Before studying at U of A, I earned my bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Beijing Normal University, China. I have received training in psychology, psychometric measurement, and data science, and have been an active researcher in the areas of psychoeducational studies, predictive learning analytics and cognitive modeling.

My primary focus of current research is on the joint of educational psychometric measurement and data science. Concretely, I am interested in developing and applying novel computational methods (e.g., deep learning) to uncover and facilitate student learning based on the structured and unstructured data on students’ interactions with digital learning environments. I am also interested in adapting data science techniques to address conventional psychometric measurement problems.

In the long term, I see myself engaged in a career devoted to active research in developments and applications of advanced data mining and psychometric methods serving the purpose of deciphering student learning in the digital age. I am looking forward to any potential collaborations.
