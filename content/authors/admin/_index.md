role: Assistant Professor of Data Science in Education

I am an Assistant Professor in the Faculty of Education at the University of Macau. I completed my Ph.D. in Measurement, Evaluation, and Data Science at the University of Alberta in July 2021. Before studying at U of A, I earned my bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Beijing Normal University, China. I have received training in psychology, educational measurement, and data science, and have been an active researcher in the areas of psychoeducational studies, learning analytics, and educational data mining.

My primary focus of current research is on the intersection of education and data science. Specifically, I am interested in developing and applying novel computational methods (e.g., deep learning) to characterize, interpret, and promote student learning based on both structured and unstructured learner data from students’ interactions with digital learning environments. I am also interested in applying data science techniques to address a wide range of issues in education.

In the long term, I see myself engaged in a career devoted to active interdisciplinary research in developing and applying cutting-edge statistical, psychometric, and data science approaches to decipher student learning and address complex assessment issues emerged in other settings (e.g., cognitive science, health, and business). I am looking forward to any potential collaborations.
